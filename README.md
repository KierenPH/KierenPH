### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17 year old computer science student studying for an A-Level.

I currently code in Python and JS, hopefully this expands soon :D

## My Projects
# Complete Projects:
Alexa Fruit Machine - An alexa skill that operates like a slot machine with an online synced leaderboard accessable by the skill!
# WIP Projects:
Ascella - An all in one discord bot coded in JS in a team, come check us out at https://ascella.dev(Site is WIP)
Python Casino - A GUI casino written in Python using the pygame library.

Is there anything else you think I should work on? Let me know by email at hello@kieren.uk!
